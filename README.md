# Open-Source-Anti-Virus

The following are random notes compiled from our group discussions:

But for now, would be helpful if you could try reading about ways of comparing the hex of two files.

But right now, I'd suggest you read how to make Python scripts run in the background and on startup (when the computer starts up after shutdown or sleep, the script should run again)

Notes from project meeting:
Example of list for raising awareness or something - https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios
Have two GitHub repositories - one for app code, one for list of malicious files

Git commit -m “type in your message (issue #x)” - automatically adds this commit to the specified issue (x)
Whenever you do anything new, make a new branch and do it there (never commit to master directly)
Name branch based on issue number
Don’t do anything if there’s not an issue for it (just create a new issue if one doesn’t exist yet)

Before next meeting (by April 15) - decide on more concrete architecture, choose technologies, decide who will do what, start implementation
